The scope of the project is to reproduce the 4-CH teleopration architecture proposed in D. Sun, F. Naghdy and H. Du, "Wave-Variable-Based Passivity Control of Four-Channel Nonlinear Bilateral Teleoperation System Under Time Delays," in IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 238-253, Feb. 2016, doi: 10.1109/TMECH.2015.2442586.

The "robot" implemented is a very simple 1 DOF bar actuated by an electrical motor.

The implementation is made entirely in Matlab Simulink and use Level2 S-functions to create the passivity observer/controller described in the paper.

Results in constant and variable delay listed below.

An ablation test has also been performed to verify the impact of each feature in the architecture.
